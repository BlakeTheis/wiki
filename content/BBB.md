# CTF Team

We started a new CTF team during Spring 2021.

**scriptohio** is a team consisting of OSU students. We also sometimes go by "Buckeye Bureau of BOF" (bof = buffer overflow)

Planned
-----

We tend to play CTFs on a whim instead of planning them ahead of time. The CTF Team Captain decides what we're playing and when we're meeting up.


Team Members
-------

There are too many members to appropriately list here, as many people will participate in some CTFs and not others. See the CTF Team role on Discord (see below) for a full list of members.
- **Want to join?** It's easy, just watch for announcements in our Discord and join us for our next CTF!

Join us on Discord

Since essentially all of the competitions have no team size limit, any OSU student can join us!
