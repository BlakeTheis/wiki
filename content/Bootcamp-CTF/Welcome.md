## What is a CTF?

Capture the Flag (CTF) is a hacking competition in which players compete to obtain “flags” by solving security-based problems.

This means you'll be breaking into vulnerable computer systems. No, not just any system -- we've  set up over 20 applications accessible on the internet for you to hack. 

## How does this work?

This CTF is 'jeopardy-style'. That means we will give you challenges in a variety of categories (reverse engineering, binary exploitation, web, cryptography, etc.) and each challenge will have a point value depending on its difficulty.

## What is a flag?

A flag is a secret string. It is often stored in a database or a file, and you'll have to hack something to access it.

For our event, all flags will be of the format **osuctf{...}**. For example, if you sign up you can claim the following flag for 1 point on the challenge named "sanity check" :)

```
osuctf{th4nk5_f0r_r34d1ng}
```


## What's in it for me?

You'll learn in-demand skills that could lead to a career in cybersecurity. Even if you don't intend to work in cyber, you'll gain an understanding of a variety of flaws in computer systems and how to avoid introducing them in your own code.

### Prizes
Ohio State University students are also eligible for prizes. **Prizes are while supplies last.**

Students who receive at least 250 points in the CTF will receive a sticker (100 available):

## Is this legal?

Cyber Security Club @ Ohio State grants you permission to exploit the services we have specifically set up for this CTF, and we will identify these by IP address or domain name. **Use of the techniques or skills you demonstrate here on systems other than those involved in this competition may be a violation of law in your jurisdiction.** Please see our [disclaimer](#disclaimer).

## How do I start!?

1. Create an account on the CTF scoreboard: https://bootcamp.osucyber.club (link also at top of this page)
2. Join our Discord: https://discord.osucyber.club/
3. Check out our [Getting Started](/Bootcamp-CTF/Getting-Started) pages

## Can I work with others?

Although this is not a team competition, **you are free to discuss approaches to the challenges, tools you used, important concepts, and you are free to give and receive small hints on our Discord**. Please do not give flags or solution guides/scripts to other participants.
