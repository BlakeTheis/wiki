# Challenge Types


- [Web](/Bootcamp-CTF/Challenge-Types/Web) - Vulnerabilities in web applications such as SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), logic bugs, and more.
- [Binary Exploitation](/Bootcamp-CTF/Challenge-Types/Pwn) - We will primarily focus on identifying and exploiting memory corruption and logic bugs in executable programs. This includes some analysis of machine code.
- [Reversing](/Bootcamp-CTF/Challenge-Types/Reversing) - Reverse engineering includes reverse engineering how a program works, without source code. (includes mobile applications, web applications, IoT firmware, ...). 
- [Crypto](/Bootcamp-CTF/Challenge-Types/Crypto) - Learn about implementation flaws in encryption schemes that can allow you to decrypt encrypted data sent between two parties (like over the internet).
- [Forensics](/Bootcamp-CTF/Challenge-Types/Forensics) - Forensics is the art of recovering useful information obtained from traffic captures, full disk images, a variety of common file formats (including data hidden in images), and more. This often includes seemingly deleted or covertly recorded data.
