# How to Hack

Hacking is a pretty cool technical skill, and one of the goals of this club is to help students get good at it. We try to provide a wealth of opportunities for people to learn and practice. Specifically, we recommend you:
- Attend club meetings, even if you won't 100% understand what's being presented or discussed.
- Participate in Capture the Flag (CTF) events and other hands-on opportunities, even if you have no idea where to start.
- Read hacking articles people send in Slack/Discord and other places you find them, even if you don't 100% understand the content.
- Google search anything you don't know, and read StackOverflow posts/blogs/documentation that answers your questions and more.
- Interact with and ask questions of other people in the club.

However, cybersecurity is a wide topic, so we can't teach you everything and part of learning to hack is learning how to take advantage of the enormous amount of resources on the internet. We recommend a balance of reading to learn about new topics and practicing hands-on projects to gain experience with topics. **To get started on your journey, check out this [Start Hacking](https://liveoverflow.com/start-hacking/) page from LiveOverflow, a popular YouTube creator with cybersecurity-related videos. After that, look at the [Resources](/resources) page and get hacking!**
