# Club History

## Origin Story
Per Aaron McCanty, the club started as an after-work gathering of Battelle employees. Battelle expanded after-work social hours, which involved working on CTF problems together and generally discussing anything cyber-related, to include the co-op students and their friends. Eventually a few of the co-ops and their friends had a class with Steve Romig, who helped to form an official student organization, though at the beginning there were more Battelle employees than students going to meetings. This changed over time, with the biggest student growth occurring around the time Cam Taylor was president, as he was not originally a Battelle employee.

## Additional Research
Aaron recounts that the club was founded around 2015/2016, but we've also found some documents about an OSU Capture the Flag Group stretching back to October 2013, so we're not exactly sure of the timeline. Here's what we do know:
- [Steve Romig's blog](https://u.osu.edu/romig.1/) ([archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20191114101121/https://u.osu.edu/romig.1/)) mentions creating a blog site for the OSU CTF group on October 21, 2013.
- The [OSU Capture the Flag Group blog site](https://u.osu.edu/osuctf/) ([archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201031114826/https://u.osu.edu/osuctf/)) has posts from December 2014 to March 2015 discussing club meetings and CTF writeups.
- The "CTF" tab of the OSU CTF Group blog site lists the Group Google account as 0xbb0000.0x666666@gmail.com. We don't currently have access to this account, though we haven't tried asking Steve about it since we haven't had a need to.
- The OSU CTF Group blog site sidebar and "Calendar" tab link to an [osu-ctf Google calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=jlqlnbafreejb6385lr9fge9vo%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York) which shows meetings between 2 December 2014 and 26 May 2015.
- The "CTF" tab of the OSU CTF Group blog site also links to the [osu-ctf OSU mailing list](https://lists.osu.edu/mailman/listinfo/osu-ctf) ([archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210221235918/https://lists.osu.edu/mailman/listinfo/osu-ctf)), which lists its administrators as romig.1 (Steve Romig), reynolds.795 (likely Bobby Reynolds, see past officers table) and gordon.688 (likely Kyle Gordon, see past officers table).
- The original OSU CTF Group was the [`#bb0000#666666` team on CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/team/12129).
